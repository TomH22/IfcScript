This is a project by Building SMART to generate example IFC files.
Primarily for IFC4 (but not restricted to this schema), it is 
intended to concentrate on samples and unit tests demonstrating
features and improvements in IFC4.

It uses the Geometry Gym open source toolkit (MIT License) available from
https://github.com/jmirtsch/GeometryGymIFC or nuget to generate the classes and files.
